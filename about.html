<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<div class="paragraph">
	<p>We drive scalable solutions to transform the lives of people with disabilities, people in poverty and people facing homelessness: solutions that contribute to righting societal imbalances.</p>
	</div>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	<div class="paragraph">
	<p>We envision a city where everyone has a roof over their head, is healthy, productive and can enjoy the social connections that create a life of purpose. Were a nonprofit with a staff of close to 2,000 that provides $185 million in services. Our efforts are supported by various local, state and federal government entities as well as foundations, corporations and individual donors. Most importantly, our vision allows us to deliver the same quality of services to one individual or to thousands. No challenge is beyond our scope.</p>

<h2>Our Uniqueness</h2>
<div class="paragraph">

	<p><strong>"We don't empower people. We give people the tools to empower themselves."
	- Donna Colonna, CEO</strong></p>

	<p>At SUS, we don't prescribe paths that define people but offer solutions that support each person's definition of a life of purpose. When you look closely, the injustices facing our society are really a universe of highly individual obstacles. When an individual's life is put on hold for circumstances unique to them, establishing a relationship with them is step one. It's our guide to the services we provide. The results: Individuals and families no longer limited by their obstacles but propelled by opportunities for a richer experience with the world. A ripple effect that extends from individuals out into their communities.</p>
